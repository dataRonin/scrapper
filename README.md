SCRAPPER
--------

A simple script in python to scrape the ESIP Envirosensing website into PDF files. We use them for our monthly archives. The site is hard coded into this program, but it's easy to tell where, and you could easily reuse this structure for just about any site. It's a huge timesaver for me!
